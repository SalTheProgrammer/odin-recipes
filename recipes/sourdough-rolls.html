        <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2.5 cups sourdough starter</li>
            <li>1.5 cups water</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring sourdough starter to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Heat water to 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) in a saucepan. Transfer to a glass bowl; add yeast. Cover with plastic wrap; let stand about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir melted butter and sugar together in a bowl. Add butter mixture to yeast water; stir in starter.</li>
            <li>Combine 3 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Add starter mixture slowly; mix well. Stir in 2 cups flour; turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
           <li>Knead in as much remaining flour as possible to create a stiff, smooth ball, at least 10 minutes. Transfer ball to a lightly oiled bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, 45 minutes to 2 hours.</li>
           <li>Punch dough down; turn out onto a floured surface. Divide into 14 balls; cover and let rise for 30 minutes.</li>
           <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sprinkle cornmeal onto a baking sheet; place dough balls on top.</li>
           <li>Place baking sheet into the preheated oven. Spray the walls of the oven with water once to create steam; bake until tops are golden, for a total of 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
